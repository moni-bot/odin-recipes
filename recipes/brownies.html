        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I know aquafaba as an ingredient might sound a bit strange, but honestly I think this is the key to the perfect brownies!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 tablespoons (120 mL) aquafaba</li>
            <li>1.5 cups (290g) organic cane sugar</li>
            <li>170g 65-75% dark chocolate</li>
            <li>112g vegan butter</li>
            <li>1.5 cups flour</li>
            <li>7 tbsp cocoa</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>85g dark chocolate</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Line an 8×8-inch (20×20 cm) square metal baking pan with parchment paper and ensure there is some overhang on the sides (this will make it easy to lift the brownies out of the pan). Preheat the oven to 350°F (176°C).</li>
            <li>Sift the flour and cocoa powder together in a medium bowl</li>
            <li>Add the aquafaba and sugar to a large mixing bowl. Use an electric handheld mixer or a stand mixer on high speed and beat the mixture for 2 ½ to 3 minutes until thickened, glossy, and wavy ribbons frequently appear in the bowl</li>
            <li>Add in the vanilla, salt, and espresso powder, and fold with a silicone spatula until well combined</li>
            <li>Melt the dark chocolate and butter over a water boiler</li>
            <li>Pour the warm butter-chocolate mixture over the aquafaba-sugar mixture and fold together with the silicone spatula</li>
            <li>Bake the brownies in the preheated oven for 34 to 37 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out with some moist crumbs and/or a tiny bit of thick batter (the latter could be the melted chocolate chips). If the batter is liquidy or runny, though, the brownies need about 5 more minutes in the oven.To avoid overbaking and since every home oven varies, I err on the side of underbaking and check the brownies 5 minutes before I think they're going to be done. My oven usually takes between 34 and 37 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the brownies to a wire rack to cool for 30 minutes. Then carefully lift the brownies out of the pan using the parchment paper handles onto the wire rack. Allow to cool for a further 20 to 30 minutes before slicing. Slice the brownies and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
